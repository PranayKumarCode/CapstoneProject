# Optimal Portfolio Allocation with Public and Private Assets

The gold standard for portfolio allocations today is the 60/40 model which invests 60% in public equities, and 40% in fixed income. However, with the rise of alternative investments, such as private equity funds, what is the optimal allocation now? In this capstone research project, we endeavoured to answer this question.

Certain elements of this work are protected under agreements. As such, the proprietary code and dataset behind the simulation and optimization models cannot be publicly released. Nonetheless, we provide an overview of the methodology and results based on the publicly available subset of the project.
